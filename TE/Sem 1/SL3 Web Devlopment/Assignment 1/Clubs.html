                    <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of
                        holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. ... The game at the usual level is played on a
                        course with an arranged progression of 18
                        holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes.</p>

                    <p>A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known
                        as football. Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to
                        represent a football club, group, state or nation,
                        an all-star team or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a Dream Team or Team of the
                        Century) and never play an actual match.</p>

                    </font>
                    <p>The club still cherishes the pride of having one of the best cricket grounds in the city. The
                        mark of the British is also an added heritage of the club. Currently we have a new lit practice
                        facility of 22 practice wickets including 9 wickets with box nets. The playing field and pitch
                        are planted with Bermuda grass which grows faster and makes for speedier and competitive play.
                        This is supported by popup sprinklers that help maintaining the water requirements of the grass
                        and all this to meet international standards.</p>

                    </font>
                    <p>Volleyball is a popular team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each
                        team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.
                        It has been a part of the official program
                        of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.</p>
